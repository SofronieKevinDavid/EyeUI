# Project Title

I made a game as a site for people with eyesight problems, "Eye". An user can log in, play the game and track his score.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
These is the readme for both the backend and the frontend part of the project, both located in my github repository.

## Installing

You need to run the EyeApplication.java from an IDE, or make a jar file and then run it from the command prompt. The UI part is in a separate project. Then just run the "index.html" file (from WebStorm for example, or with tomcat), after the backend is up and running.

## Running the tests

The tests from the java part of the exam have to coincide with the DB fields in order to run successfully.

## Built With

* [Spring]- The "framework of frameworks" for the backend
* [Spring Boot]- To just "run" a project as a standalone app
* [JQuery]- The web framework used
* [Maven]- Dependency Management

## Programming Languages

* [Java]- For backend
* [Javascript]- For frontend
* [Css]- For frontend
* [Html]- For frontend
